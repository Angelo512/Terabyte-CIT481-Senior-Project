## **Lambda Functions**

Two .py files are here: 
- `StartEC2Instance.py`
- `StopEC2Instance.py`

In short, these python files can be used as reference when creating the two lambda functions that start and stop your ec2 instances. 

**_NOTE_**

Make sure that you attach a role with the ec2fullaccess policy attached to it
